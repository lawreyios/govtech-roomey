## Pre-requisites

1. macOS 10.15 or later
2. Xcode 11.5 or later
3. Carthage 0.34.0 or later Installed ([Setup guide here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage))
4. Valid Apple Developer Account signed-in in Xcode

## Clone the project

1. Perform `git clone https://github.com/lawreyios/govtech-roomey.git` from your **Terminal**.
2. Go into the root directory with `cd govtech-roomey/Roomey`.
3. Run `carthage bootstrap --platform iOS` to install dependencies.

## Run the app

1. Open **Roomey.xcodeproj** with Xcode.
2. Ensure **Scheme** is at **Roomey-DEV**.
3. If you are running on **Simulator**, you have to upload an image to simulate hard-coded data, else you can connect your **actual iOS device** of **iOS 13.5 and above** to run the native QR Code Scanner.
3. Run the app with **►**.

## Run the app's test suite

1. Open **Roomey.xcodeproj** with Xcode.
2. Ensure **Scheme** is at **Roomey-DEV**.
3. Go to **Product -> Test** or **⌘U** to run the tests.

## Assumptions 

1. Next earliest possible time selection is at least 30 mins later.
2. The latest possible date selection is one month in advance.
3. Weekends, holidays and any other special days are not taken into account.
4. Majority of the users will select date than scan using QR Code, so the app will auto focus on the Date Field when first enter the page.
5. There might be round-the-clock booking in future that can be added to the system, so allowing 24 hours booking in the picker.
